Block text as an HTML `<p>` element.

### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Minimal usage

<Canvas of={ParagraphStories.MinimalUsage} />

### Usage criteria

- All body text should be contained in a `Paragraph`, regardless of length.
- If the `Paragraph` is on a dark background, the `invert` prop must be used to maintain sufficient colour contrast.
- If other modifications must be made to the text inside a `Paragraph` such as size or font weight, use the `Text`, `Small`, and `Strong` components.

### Placing text on dark colours

Use the invert prop.
