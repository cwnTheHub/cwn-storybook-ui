`import {PriceLockup} from '@nds_core/nds'`

### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Usage Criteria

- `PriceLockup` is available in three different sizes:
  - Use `small` for pricing in product catalogue pages (not in cards)
  - Use `medium` for pricing in product compare cards
  - Use `large` for pricing in banners and promo cards
- Sizes refer to the relative size of text within `PriceLockup` rather than viewport
  - The large `PriceLockup` displays responsively based on viewport
  - Must not display `bottomText` in large `PriceLockup`
- Must use the `price` prop to provide monetary value
- Use `rateText` prop to provide month or year
- Use `topText` and `bottomText` props to provide additional information
- Align the currency sign to the right when displaying prices in French
- Use `strikethrough` prop for price savings comparison
  - If using `strikethrough` prop, it must be accompanied by corresponding `a11yText` to be used by screen readers
  - `strikethrough` price must be smaller than the discounted price
- Use `a11yText` prop to support screen reader when text is not reader-friendly
  - Problem: if the component shows "\$25/mo.", screen reader will read: "dollar 25 slash mo"
  - Solution: supply component with `a11yText="25 dollars per month"`. Screen reader will now read: "25 dollars per month" and ignore visual text

### Strikethrough Usage Criteria

- Usage: To visually show a discounted price next to a non-strikethrough price
- Placement: Must be placed in close proximity to the product
- If using `strikethrough` prop, it must be accompanied by corresponding `a11yText` to be used by screen readers
- a11yText will override strikethrough price, so it must include price (ie. "was 50 dollars per month")

  - Display in the same line as the `price`, `rateText` or `bottomText` when thereâ€™s available space
  - Display with `rateText` or `bottomText`, whichever is the last element
- If there are more than 3 `FootnoteLinks`
  - Display `FootnoteLinks` as the last element (bottom) of `PriceLockup`
