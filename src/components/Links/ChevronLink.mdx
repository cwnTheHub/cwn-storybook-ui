### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />
### Minimal usage

A Chevron Link is a navigational element that should only be used as a standalone call to action.

By default, Chevron Links will be displayed in the `primary` variant.

<Canvas of={ChevronLinkStories.Primary} />

### Usage criteria

- Chevron Links have a fixed font size of 1rem and it should not change
- Due to the chevron's hover animation, provide ample whitespace so that it does not overlap with nearby elements
- Do not place them within other paragraph text
- They can appear below or next to [Button Links](/docs/core-components-links-button-link--documentation) as a secondary call to action
- We recommend a character range between 2-32 characters

Specify the variant to create a button for secondary actions.

<Canvas of={ChevronLinkStories.Secondary} />

### Placing Chevron Links on solid colours

Use the inverted Chevron Link on top of any solid dark colour.

<Story of={ChevronLinkStories.Inverted} />

### Using Chevron Link for navigation in a multi-step operation

Chevron Link can be used as a "back" button by specifying the `direction`. These are not suitable for breadcrumb navigation due to the chevron's hover animation.

### Using A11yContent

Use the `A11yContent` component to create invisible text that is read out loud by screen readers.
