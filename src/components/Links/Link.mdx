- Available as Default (Shark Grey) or Invert (White)
- May include an icon, see **Links with icons** below
- May open link in a new window/tab
  - Use Links with icons; use the `LinkExternal` icon to support recognition
  - Provide appropriate text as part of the label or visually hidden text to anticipate user expectation
  - Recommend to limit use when the source will direct the user away from critical or focused user flow

### Minimal usage

<Story of={LinkStories.MinimalUsage} />

### Inverted

<Story of={LinkStories.Inverted} />

### Links with icons

The `Dependent` InteractiveIcon group can be used within Link.

#### Guidelines

- May align icon to the left or right
- Donâ€™t use in headings
- Recommend to align icon to the right when used as an inline text link
- Recommend to align icon to the left when used as
  - Single independent link with icon
  - Group of independent links with icon
- The icon will default to its 24px size, or adapt to the font size of the wrapping `Paragraph` or `Text` component
  - On `large` or `medium` `Paragraph` or `Text` sizes, the icon will be 24px
  - On `small` `Paragraph` or `Text` sizes, the icon will be 20px
  - Use [`core-paragraph`](/docs/core-components-typography-paragraph--documentation) or [`core-text`](/docs/core-components-typography-text--documentation) to have `Link` inherit the size of the wrapping component

The following icons are available for use in Links:

### Using with React Router Links

When using Link with React Router, you must pass in the React Router Link component as a prop. Our intention is to have developers supply the React Router Link component whether they are on version 3 of React Router, or are using the latest React Router DOM package on version 4. This way, we avoid deep dependency conflicts.

It is recommended to set up a component wrapper in your project to avoid repetition, like so:

**LinkWrapper.jsx**

```jsx noeditor static
import React from "react";

// React Router version 3
import { Link as ReactRouterLink } from "react-router";

// React Router version 4 and above
// import { Link as ReactRouterLink } from 'react-router-dom'

import Link from "../../core/core-link/Link";

// If you're importing from @nds_core/nds, write this as:
//`import {Link} from '@nds_core/nds';

const LinkWrapper = ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <Link
    {...rest}
    reactRouterLinkComponent={rest.to ? ReactRouterLink : undefined}
  >
    {children}
  </Link>
);

export default LinkWrapper;
```

**App.js**

```js noeditor static
import Link from "./LinkWrapper";

const MyApp = () => (
  <main>
    ...
    <Link to="/more">Read More</Link>
    <Link href="https://www.xyz.com/">website url</Link>
  </main>
);
```

This way, you can output normal anchors or react router links using a single component.
