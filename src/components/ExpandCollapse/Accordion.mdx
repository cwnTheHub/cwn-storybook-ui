### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

The `Accordion` has the same design and behaviours as the `ExpandCollapse`, except that only one panel can be opened at
a time.

Note that the `Accordion`'s `open` prop accepts only a single string, while the `ExpandCollapse`'s `open` prop accepts an
array of strings.

### Minimal usage

This example looks visually similar to the `ExpandCollapse` one above, however, only one panel can be open at a time.
