### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />
### Usage criteria

The `ExpandCollapse` and `Accordion` component allows nesting of content inside a collapsible container. Activating the header will reveal the hidden content by expanding the container.

- Carefully consider the type of content to hide and reveal with motion
- Use static content within Panels such as text, links, and images
- Avoid complex interactions within Panels such as tabs, carousels or nested accordions. The extra layers make it confusing and difficult for customers to orient themselves. The customer needs to be able to navigate to other parts of the page after the content is expanded
- May display as a non-interactive `ExpandCollapse` heading
  - Donâ€™t include content in the `ExpandCollapse.Panel` to display a non-interactive heading without the hide and reveal functionality, and not displaying the Caret icon
  - Limit use to displaying a list of product items

### Minimal usage

<Canvas of={ExpandCollapseStories.MinimalUsage} />
Example using `compact` prop.

<Canvas of={ExpandCollapseStories.WithCompactProp} />

Example of a list of product items displaying points or price information as a series of `ExpandCollapse` panels. A non-interactive `ExpandCollapse.Panel` can be used to arrange items and their corresponding numerals consistently.
