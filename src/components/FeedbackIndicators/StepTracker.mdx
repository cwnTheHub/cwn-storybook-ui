Show the current position in a sequence of steps.

### Usage criteria

As the user progresses through the steps, tell StepTracker which step is active with the current prop. 
StepTracker will indicate both the active step and the completed steps.

StepTracker adjusts to accommodate smaller screens by hiding the labels, displaying only a summary. 
Resize your browser window to see this behavior.

Note this component is not interactive, so the user cannot use it to navigate through the steps. 
The application will need to provide its own navigation mechanism and state control. StepTracker 
also does not prevent the current step from reaching integers beyond the number of steps provided; 
the application must prevent negative or exceeding steps from being reached by the customer.
