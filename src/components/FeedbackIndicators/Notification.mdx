A banner that highlights important messages.

### Usage criteria

A banner that highlights important messages.

Notifications are used to let users know:

- System status such as an error or outage
- Their actions have triggered a change such as confirmation of a payment
- Information such as letting the user know they have almost used all their data

Colours help indicate the type of message. For errors use a red background. 
For other notifications use grey. Lastly, if the message is promotional use branded colours. 
These are reflected in code via the variant prop, and the background colour will change to match the desiered variant. 
For example, the error variant will produce a red background.
