### Usage criteria

- Avoid using a spinner whenever possible. Make content available to the user as soon as possible
- User feedback should be present when a user action takes longer than 0.1 seconds
- A Spinner is most appropriate for providing feedback for actions that last between 2 and 10 seconds
- Actions that take longer than 10 seconds ideally provide feedback with relative progress, such as a progress bar
- Recommend not to use for full page loading
- Label should be short and concise. Spinner label should accurately explain the state of the requested action along with relevant items being loaded, "Loading page content", "Logging in", "Processing payment"
- Use the small spinner when applied on a button or other small interactive elements such as toggles or links
    - When overlaying buttons, the spinnerâ€™s colour should match the button's colour (green spinner for green buttons, and purple spinner for purple buttons)
- Use the large spinner when affecting an entire web page or content block, whose content has not finished loading, such as paginated content
- Both the small and large spinner have an overlay background to visually indicate content behind it is inaccessible. Use the standalone spinner (small/large) as an interstitial placeholder for loading content

# Minimal implementation

- To make the Spinner visible, set the spinning prop to true
- Provide a label to give more context about what is happening
    - The label prop is a string or node that acts as both a line of text under the Spinner as well as text that is communicated to assistive technology
    - Use A11yContent to provide information to assistive technology that should not appear in the Spinner's visible label. This content must be wrapped with a React.Fragment or span if A11yContent is being used. In the next major update, the label prop will be required in code
