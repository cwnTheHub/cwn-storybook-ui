### PROPS & METHODS

### Spacing levels

The spacing system defines 8 levels of spacing. Levels `4` and above are always responsive by default, as detailed below:

| Level | Default value | Value in viewports greater or equal to `768px` |
| ----- | ------------: | ---------------------------------------------: |
| 1     | 0.25rem (4px) |                                    _unchanged_ |
| 2     |  0.5rem (8px) |                                    _unchanged_ |
| 3     |   1rem (16px) |                                    _unchanged_ |
| 4     | 1.5rem (24px) |                                    2rem (32px) |
| 5     |   2rem (32px) |                                    3rem (48px) |
| 6     | 2.5rem (40px) |                                    4rem (64px) |
| 7     |   3rem (48px) |                                  4.5rem (72px) |
| 8     |   4rem (64px) |                                    6rem (96px) |

### Recommended usage

- Use levels `1`-`3` to space inline content, such as [Typography](#/Typography), [Buttons](#/Forms?id=button), or [Icons](#/Icons)
- Use levels `4`-`8` to space block content, such as [Cards](#/Content?id=card) or [Dividers](#/Layout?id=section-dividers)
- Use levels `5`, `7`, and `8` to vertically stack full-width Blocks

These examples showcase all of the `Box` properties working together to control both inset (padding) and stacking (margin).
Note the compositional nature of `Box`. Use multiple Boxes to achieve complex layouts.

<Canvas of={BoxStories.Example} />

<Canvas of={BoxStories.ExampleInline} />

### Responsiveness

The `Box` component is also capable of setting certain box sizes at specific viewport breakpoints. Designers should use best practices and recommended spacing if the current behaviour of `Box` levels does not solve a design's needs.

In the following example, resize your browser window to see different `Box` sizing at different viewport widths:

<Canvas of={BoxStories.Responsiveness} />

This will do the following:

- Padding on all sides will increase as the viewport size increases to take advantage of the extra space
- Spacing between the buttons will increase as the viewport size increases to make things look less dense on larger screens
- Below the `lg` viewport (â‰¤992px), `inline` will be set to `false`, making the buttons stack. On `lg` and larger, the buttons will appear side to side

### Using space-between

This prop implements `justify-content: space-between;` in CSS. With `space-between`, the space is dynamically determined based on the size of the box, and the elements inside are distributed evenly from the start to the end.

#### Without space-between

<Canvas of={BoxStories.WithoutSpaceBetween} />

#### With space-between

<Canvas of={BoxStories.WithSpaceBetween} />

Use `space-between` to space elements inside of `Box` evenly, dynamically fitted to the `Box`'s size.
