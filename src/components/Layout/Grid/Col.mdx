## Inputs

The component accepts the following inputs (props):

<Controls />

### Responsive column widths
Use the xs, sm, md, lg and xl props to set the number of column widths to span. When not specified, columns will automatically span equal widths in their row. If the prop is set to 0, the column at that breakpoint will be hidden.

The column span props correspond to their min-width breakpoints. For example, when md is defined as 6, your column width will be 6 from the md breakpoint and greater, unless you specify a value for lg or xl.

Refer to the table in the Responsive section for the breakpoints.

<Canvas of={ColStories.ResponsiveColumnWidths} />

#### Offsetting columns
Move columns to the right using the responsive offset props.

<Canvas of={ColStories.OffsettingColumns} />

### Hiding Columns
Hide columns starting from certain breakpoints by setting the corresponding prop for the target breakpoint range as 0. If a breakpoint is defined as 0, it will affect all other breakpoints after it until a latter breakpoint assigned as not 0 nor undefined is found.

In the following example, the second column is set to hidden for xs, sm, and xl breakpoints. This column is not hidden for md and lg breakpoints.

<Canvas of={ColStories.HidingColumns} />

### Aligning Column Content
Use the horizontalAlign prop to align the content of a column.

<Canvas of={ColStories.AligningColumnContent} />
