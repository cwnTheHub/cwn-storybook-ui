A mobile-first flexbox grid.
## Inputs

The component accepts the following inputs (props):

<Controls />

### Usage 

The FlexGrid system is a thin wrapper over react-flexbox-grid, which implements flexboxgrid.css. It uses a series of rows and columns to layout and align content 2-dimensionally.

If you are new to or unfamiliar with flexbox, read this CSS Tricks flexbox guide for background, terminology, guidelines, and code snippets.

#### Accessibility
- FlexGrid helps with building responsive interfaces and provide first-class support to customers using any screen size. Use the FlexGrid’s responsive props to help achieve responsive content
- By default, FlexGrid implements limitWidth in order to keep all content aligned on the left and right sides of a page. It uses rem units to grow in width and respond to browser font size configurations
Below is a quick example of how the components fit together. See the FlexGrid.Row and FlexGrid.Col components below for a more in-depth look.

<Canvas of={FlexGridStories.Accessibility} />

#### How it works
- FlexGrid is the top-level container. It centers and horizontally pads your site’s contents
- FlexGrid.Rows are wrappers for columns. Columns have horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them
- Place content inside FlexGrid.Col components. These should be the immediate children of rows
- Columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns
- Column widths can be made responsive by using the responsive props, which match the props used in Responsive: xs, sm, md, lg and xl
- The responsive column widths are based on minimum width media queries, so they apply to the specified breakpoint and all those above it

#### Removing the gutter

Remove the 16px gutter surrounding columns by passing gutter={false} to the FlexGrid container. This removes the horizontal padding from all child columns.

<Canvas of={FlexGridStories.RemovingTheGutter} />

#### Removing the outside 

In some layouts, there might be the need to remove the gutter from the left and right of the row. For example, if the layout requires a FlexGrid to be nested under another FlexGrid Column, the child FlexGrid's columns will not line up with the parent FlexGrid's columns due to the additional gutter between the child columns.

It is possible to avoid this situation while keeping the gutters between the columns, to do so, pass outsideGutter={false} to the child FlexGrid. This will remove the gutter on the left and the right of the FlexGrid.

outsideGutter should not be false if parent FlexGrid has gutter={false}

<Canvas of={FlexGridStories.RemovingTheOutsideGutter} />

#### Working with full-width and limited-width content
Pages should have multiple instances of FlexGrid to separate full-width content and regular limited-width content. See expanded example by clicking the full-screen icon below.

<Canvas of={FlexGridStories.FullWidth} />

#### Reversing item order
On certain layouts, the order of items within the FlexGrid may need to be reversed. To do this, set the corresponding prop for the target breakpoint range as true. If a breakpoint is defined as true, it will affect all other breakpoints after it until a latter breakpoint assigned as false is found.

In the following example, the items are set to reverse until the md breakpoint. Then, at the xl breakpoint, the items will reverse again.

<Canvas of={FlexGridStories.ReverseItemOrder} />
