## Inputs

The component accepts the following inputs (props):

<Controls />

The Responsive component is a thin wrapper over the react-media community component, which "listens for matches to a CSS media query and renders its child component based on whether the query matches or not."

The package also contains a media utility (documented below). In most cases we recommend using the media utility over the Responsive React component since they do not adversely affect server-side rendering. While not recommended for general use, the Responsive component is useful if you want to do something programmatically. For example, changing a prop or swapping a component on resize.

#### Breakpoints
The included media utility and the Responsive component both use the same breakpoint keys. The following chart details these breakpoint keys, and what values they represent.

| Breakpoint | minWidth Value | maxWidth Value |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| sm | 576px | 575px |
| md | 768px | 767px |
| lg | 992px | 991px |
| xl | 1200px | 1199px |



#### Responsive component usage
Use the render prop for the common case of rendering a component only when the media query matches.

Use the minWidth and maxWidth props to configure viewport size ranges. The breakpoint specifiers will be converted to pixel-based media queries.

For more power use a child function, whose only argument will be a boolean flag that indicates whether the media query matches or not.

The Responsive React component is a thin wrapper over the react-media community component, which "listens for matches to a CSS media query and renders its child component based on whether the query matches or not." While it is available, this component is not recommended for most use-cases.

#### media utility usage
To generate media queries for your styled-components, first import the named media export from @tds/core-responsive in your .jsx file.

`` import { Media } from '@nds_core/nds' ``

After importing, the media object, it can be used to add media-queries to your component.

```
const SomeComponent = styled.div({
  color: 'red',
  ...media.from('md').css({
    color: 'blue',
  }),
  ...media.from('lg').css({
    color: 'green',
  }),
})

```

media functions can be chained to create more complex media-queries

```
const SomeOtherComponent = styled.div({
  color: 'red',
  ...media
    .from('md')
    .until('lg')
    .and('(orientation: landscape)')
    .css({
      color: 'blue',
    }),
})

```
