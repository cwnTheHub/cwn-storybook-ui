### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

The Responsive component is a thin wrapper over the react-media community component, which "listens for matches to a CSS media query and renders its child component based on whether the query matches or not."

The package also contains a media utility (documented below). In most cases we recommend using the media utility over the Responsive React component since they do not adversely affect server-side rendering. While not recommended for general use, the Responsive component is useful if you want to do something programmatically. For example, changing a prop or swapping a component on resize.

#### Breakpoints

The included media utility and the Responsive component both use the same breakpoint keys. The following chart details these breakpoint keys, and what values they represent.

| Breakpoint | minWidth Value | maxWidth Value |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| sm         | 576px          | 575px          |
| md         | 768px          | 767px          |
| lg         | 992px          | 991px          |
| xl         | 1200px         | 1199px         |

#### Responsive component usage

Use the render prop for the common case of rendering a component only when the media query matches.

Use the minWidth and maxWidth props to configure viewport size ranges. The breakpoint specifiers will be converted to pixel-based media queries.

For more power use a child function, whose only argument will be a boolean flag that indicates whether the media query matches or not.

<Canvas of={ResponsiveStories.FunctionUsage} />

Use the query prop if you need to match on other media features.

### defaultMatches prop for server-side rendering

This component comes with a defaultMatches prop and its default is set to true.

When rendering on the server you can use the defaultMatches prop to set the initial state on the server to match whatever you think it will be on the client.

You can detect the user's device by analyzing the user-agent string from the HTTP request in your server-side rendering code. There are many ways of doing this, a popular tool is mobile-detect.

#### Testing responsive behaviour

Moving the responsive behaviour into JavaScript enables testing of the results of media queries, which is impossible with CSS-based media queries. It is straightforwards to mock or stub the result of a media query for testing environments. Here are some examples of how we incorporated unit tests for responsive behaviour in some of the TDS components:

- Button component tests and its corresponding JSX using the matches boolean flag
- Tooltip component tests and its corresponding JSX rendering a particular bubble only when the media query matches

To implement responsive behaviour in your component, this package provides Sass-based media queries using [**sass-mq**](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq), and a standardized set of breakpoints.

The `Responsive` React component is a thin wrapper over the [**react-media**](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media) community component, which "listens for matches to a CSS media query and renders its child component based on whether the query matches or not." While it is available, this component is not recommended for most use-cases.

#### media utility usage

To generate media queries for your styled-components, first import the named media export from @tds/core-responsive in your .jsx file.

`import { Media } from '@nds_core/nds'`

After importing, the media object, it can be used to add media-queries to your component.

```
const SomeComponent = styled.div({
  color: 'red',
  ...media.from('md').css({
    color: 'blue',
  }),
  ...media.from('lg').css({
    color: 'green',
  }),
})

```

media functions can be chained to create more complex media-queries

```
const SomeOtherComponent = styled.div({
  color: 'red',
  ...media
    .from('md')
    .until('lg')
    .and('(orientation: landscape)')
    .css({
      color: 'blue',
    }),
})

```
