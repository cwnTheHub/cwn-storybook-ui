### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Minimal usage

Radio buttons are used when there is a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive and the user must select exactly one choice. In other words, clicking a non-selected radio button will deselect whatever other button was previously selected in the list. Radio groups allow users to easily compare and see options.

### Usage criteria

- Use when there can only be exactly one choice from multiple options
- Use there are 2-6 options to choose from
- Use [`Select`](#select) (dropdown) when there are over 6 options
- Use the `description` prop under special circumstances where the normal label cannot be descriptive enough
- If there are 2-6 optional variables, one of them should be "None" or "No selection"

### Controlled Radio

If it is required that the state of the `Radio` be controlled by the application or other external methods, a `checked` prop must be passed to each `Radio` that needs to be controlled. Additionally, if the user is meant to select a `Radio`, an `onChange` must be provided. If the `Radio` should not be changed by user input, a `readOnly` prop must be provided.

### Uncontrolled Radio

If it is not necessary to control `Radio` state. You can create a `Radio` without a `checked` prop, in this case the `Radio` will act as an HTML `input` with the type of `radio`. Its value can be accessed by referencing the element via a `ref`.

#### Default values

Due to the nature of uncontrolled components, you cannot set an initial `checked` property on the component. If you need to set a default state for your uncontrolled `Radio`, you can use the `defaultChecked` property as described [in the react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#default-values).

### Radio descriptions

In special circumstances, it may be impossible for the radio label to be descriptive enough for the user to make an informed choice. In these cases, use the `description` prop. This prop can be used to add descriptive text under a radio input.
