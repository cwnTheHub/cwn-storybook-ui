### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Standalone usage
While its primary use is to facilitate feedback states for other form components such as Input, you may use it standalone.

<Canvas of={InputFeedbackStories.Standalone} />

### Advanced use with form components

Passing a function that returns an InputFeedback to the helper prop of form components gives you more control over the contents of the InputFeedback component by giving you access to the feedback state of the form field and the current value.

As an example, enter a value into the field below, then click away to lose focus. If you enter less than the 16 character minimum the helper will show as an error. Enter 16 or more characters to receive the success feedback.
