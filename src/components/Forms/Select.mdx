### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Usage criteria

- Include a `placeholder` to provide instructions such as "Please selectâ€¦" as an unselectable option (recommended)
- Use when options are between 7-15 (recommended)
- For options are 6 and under, use `Radio` groups or `ButtonGroup`.
- For options 15 and above, look for alternatives (e.g grouping into categories, or input field with auto-complete etc.)

### Controlled Select

If it is required that the state of the `Select` be controlled by the application or other external methods, `value` and `onChange` props must be passed to the `Select`. If the `Select` should not be changed by user input, a `readOnly` prop must be provided.

### Uncontrolled Select

If it is not necessary to control `Select` state. You can create an `Select` without a `value` prop, in this case the `Select` will act as an HTML `select`. Its value can be accessed by referencing the element via a `ref`.

#### Default values

Due to the nature of uncontrolled components, you cannot set an initial `value` property on the component. If you need to set a default state for your uncontrolled `Select`, you can use the `defaultValue` property as described [in the react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#default-values).

### Getting feedback for entered values

#### Usage criteria for feedback

- Keep `error` text as brief as possible, **should be limited to text and links**
  - Developers can use `React.Fragment` or `<span>` when supplying custom content to the `error` prop
  - Note that the `div` tag is not valid in a `p` tag

Use the `feedback` attribute to give the user feedback regarding their selection. You can affirm that the user's selection
was correct, or highlight errors that must be corrected.



### Using Tooltip

When a more in-depth explanation is needed to fill out a `Select` properly, a `Tooltip` may be provided to the `tooltip` prop.



### Grouping options

`Select` supports option groups. By passing an array of options to a top-level `options` key, the component will render
an `<optgroup>` element along with its respective options.
