### Usage Criteria

- `Pagination` can be used in content heavy pages to divide content and present in a limited and digestible manner
- The component can take any content as children inside a Panel
- Any number of panels can be used to paginate
- Style your content within Panel however you wish

### Pagination usage and length

Depending on the viewport and the amount of panels, the `Pagination` component may render elipsis if there are many pages. The below two examples demonstrate this on both desktop and mobile.

Note that the `copy` prop must be provided at all times for the correct accessible text.
