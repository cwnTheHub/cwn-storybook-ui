### PROPS & METHODS
<Controls/>

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Minimal} />

#### Usage criteria

- Be mindful of SEO and accessibility
- Organize headers in a nested order: h1, then h2, then h3
- Try **not** to skip levels where possible: h1, then h3
- Use one h1 per page
- The semantic HTML tag and visual appearance of the Heading component can be controlled using the `level` and `tag` props together
- For Hero overlays, Headlines, or Promo blocks, use [`DisplayHeading`](?path=/docs/core-components-typography-displayheading--documentation)
- For subtext in the Hero overlays, or Headlines, use [`Text`](?path=/docs/core-components-typography-text--documentation)

#### Separating HTML tag from visual style

The `Heading` component allows developers, designers, and content editors to represent headings with a certain style
while rendering a HTML tag of their choice. It's important to maintain a correct order of heading level and not skip
levels; for example, have an `<h2>` HTML element directly follows an `<h1>`, or an `<h3>` directly follows and `<h2>`. This allows users of
assistive technology to navigate through content predictably since headings represent information
hierarchy.

In the example below, the content would appear at the top of a page, as a Promo.

- The first line of text (Consider this...) appears as a visual heading 4, but renders with an `<h1>` tag
- The second line of text (Getting membership...) appears as a visual heading 1, but renders with an `<h2>`

When we provide different heading tags, the heading hierarchy is in order for assistive technology, but we are able
to have a different visual hierarchy of text.
