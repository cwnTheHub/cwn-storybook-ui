### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Usage criteria

- In an instance when there is another sticky item on the page (i.e the cart summary unexpanded/collapsed), the `Footnote` must be layered on top of that
- Can be dismissed by clicking the close button, clicking anywhere outside of the Footnote, or by pressing `ESCAPE`

### Accessibility requirements

- Only one `Footnote` component should ever exist on a page at a time
- The `Footnote` component must be the last child in the `body` or `main`
  - When the `Footnote` is opened, the `inert` prop must be set on all children of `body` excluding the `Footnote`
- When the `Footnote` is closed, focus must be returned to the initiating element. See example below

### Available HTML tags

Some HTML tags are available in `Footnote` to fulfill some formatting requirements.

| HTML Tag | Effect                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<a>`    | Generates a TDS link component, copying the tag's attributes |
| `<br>`   | Generates a normal HTML break tag (typically used for lists) |
