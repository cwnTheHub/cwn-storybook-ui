### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

Tooltips provide a descriptive and detailed explanation or instructions to help the user fill in the form field. You may
use one when the information is useful only to a small percentage of users (ie. tech savvy people wouldn't need this info).
Tooltips may also be useful when vertical space is an issue.

Use the `direction` prop to open the tooltip to the left or right of the trigger, so that it does not block other
content on the page. Be careful not to let the Tooltip extend beyond the edge of the page if opening to the right though.

On small screen sizes Tooltips will always open to the left to ensure they will be visible.

You can also place Tooltips anywhere you like as a standalone element.

You can also invert the colour to be used on a purple background.

### Accessible copy

To indicate to assistive devices the purpose of the `Tooltip`, invisible copy is placed within the component. Passing `"en"` or `"fn"` to the `copy` prop will use the component's English and French text respectively. If the provided text is not sufficient, an object containing custom text may be provided.

When providing custom text to `a11yText`, it is required that it contain the `%{label}` token if an input is connected to the `Tooltip`. This token will substitute in the attached input's label, and is necessary for those with assistive devices to identify which input the `Tooltip` belongs to.

_To see the effects of this, use a screen reader or view the `<span>` rendered within the component that contains the accessible text._
