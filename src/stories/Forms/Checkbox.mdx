### PROPS & METHODS

<Controls />

### Minimal usage
Checkboxes are used when there are lists of options and the user may select any number of choices, including zero, one, or several. In other words, each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, so checking one box doesn't uncheck the others.

A stand-alone checkbox is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.

### Controlled Checkbox
If it is required that the state of the Checkbox be controlled by the application or other external methods, a checked prop must be passed to each Checkbox that needs to be controlled. Additionally, if the user is meant to select a Checkbox, an onChange must be provided. If the Checkbox should not be changed by user input, a readOnly prop must be provided.

### Uncontrolled Checkbox
If it is not necessary to control Checkbox state. You can create a Checkbox without a checked prop, in this case the Checkbox will act as an HTML input with the type of checkbox. Its value can be accessed by referencing the element via a ref.

### Default values
Due to the nature of uncontrolled components, you cannot set an initial checked property on the component. If you need to set a default state for your uncontrolled Checkbox, you can use the defaultChecked property as described in the react documentation.

Note: If no id is provided, a default id will be generated in the format of: "name_value"

### Getting feedback for an unchecked checkbox
Use the feedback and error props to give the user feedback regarding a missed checkbox by highlighting the label, checkbox element and adding an error message stating how to proceed.
