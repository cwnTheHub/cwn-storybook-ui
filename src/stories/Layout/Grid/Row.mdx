## Inputs

The component accepts the following inputs (props):

<Controls />

### Usage 

--- 
# Row

#### Alignment

Use flexbox alignment properties to vertically and horizontally align columns.

<Canvas of={RowStories.TheRow} />

### Distribution
Use flexbox distribution properties to control the negative space around columns.

<Canvas of={RowStories.Distribution} />

<Canvas of={RowStories.Alignment} />

#### Reversing item order
On certain layouts, the order of items within the row may need to be reversed. To do this, set the corresponding prop for the target breakpoint range as true. If a breakpoint is defined as true, it will affect all other breakpoints after it until a latter breakpoint assigned as false is found.

In the following example, the items are set to reverse until the md breakpoint. Then, at the xl breakpoint, the items will reverse again.


<Canvas of={RowStories.ReverseItemOrder} />
